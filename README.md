# Password Generator
This web application allows a user to make a randomly generated password. It is created by taking user input from a series of five prompts and using that information to create a unique password in accordance with the selected criteria.

## Features
A user can create a random password by entering the following creiteria: the length of the password (must be between 8 and 128 characters), whether to include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numeric characters, and/or special characters.

## Usage
To get started, click on the red "Generate Password" button and then a series of alerts will pop up in your browser. Type/click through the prompts in order to generate your unique password.
